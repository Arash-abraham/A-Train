# A-Train
Give the desired files to the program so that if the content of the second file is not in the first file, it will be printed for you

# Usage Example
Here, a file called things.txt contains a list of numbers. newthings.txt contains a second list of numbers, some of which appear in things.txt and some of which do not. The numbers of the second file that are not in the first file will be printed for you.
You can use regex to filter your data to get better data.
